//! Real FFT using [`microfft::real`] that is very fast and also works in
//! `no_std` environments. It is faster than regular fft (with the `rustfft`
//! crate for example). The difference to a complex FFT, as with `rustfft` is,
//! that the result vector contains fewer results as there are no mirrored
//! frequencies.

/// FFT base result type.
